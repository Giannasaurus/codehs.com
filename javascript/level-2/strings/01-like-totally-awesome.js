/** In this exercise, you are given a word or phrase and you need to return that word or phrase with the word â€˜likeâ€™ in front of it.
    If the phrase already starts with like, you should not add another one, just return the phrase as is.
  
    * Example:
      > like("totally awesome") --> "like totally awesome"
      > like("like cool dude") --> "like cool dude"
      > like("I like you") -->"like I like you" */

function like(phrase){
    const like="like ";

        return phrase;
    // 
    }else{
        return like+phrase;
    };
